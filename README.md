# CS4111-Project1

By Christian Romero and Robin Hwang for CS4111

This was a final project for our intro to databases class. We were essentially supposed to build a web-app from the ground up using our ER diagrams as scaffolding. So we thought of a potential application idea first --> built the necessary ER diagrams (relations, relationships, constraints) --> initalized Postgres using said ER diagram and programmed the application in python. Our idea was something similar akin to fitness-based reddit, where content was curated to the individual based on the topics/hobbies that they liked.

Technologies Used: Postgres, Python(Flask), HTML, CSS
